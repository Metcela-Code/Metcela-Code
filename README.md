Hi,

Metcela-Code is the script sharing space for Metcela. Our mission is to Revolutionize the Way We Treat Heart Failure!

Heart failure kills more people globally than any other ailments, yet there is no ultimate treatment for the condition.
Our goal is to develop and commercialize an effective and reasonably-priced therapy for heart failure using a specific fibroblast cells we call “VCF”, that we obtain from the patient’s own heart.
Our approach to heart failure therapy is quite different from other technologies in a sense that we do not want to replace what is “broken”, but rather we want to repair the damage by enhancing the cells’ own ability to heal.

Here, you will find all scripts used in publications by Metcela.
